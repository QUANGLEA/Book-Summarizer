;;; Project Idea
;;; Ask the user to input how many sections they want to divide the book into
;;; And how many sentences they want to see in each section's summary 
;;; Summarize each section of the book
;;; The user can ask for a specific number of keywords in the text and an image will be displayed

;;; Instructions for Using GUI:
;;; 1. Run this Racket file, and a GUI should pop up 
;;; 2. The GUI will ask for some information about the text file (use "test-sentences.txt" as an example)
;;; 3. The GUI will also ask for an output file name (name it anything with a ".txt" ending)
;;; 4. Use the slider to choose the number of sections, sentences, and keywords
;;; 5. The file where the summary and keywords visualizer will appear at the bottom after you click the button "Submit"
;;; HOPE YOU ENJOY OUR PROJECT!!!
